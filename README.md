first day assignment

My initial syntax was all correct, and I ended up taking notes to refrence for later. 

Had to troubleshoot once I had to actually got to pushing everything to Github (namely password errors), made a personal access token, did some general google-ing to double check everything.

Overall feeling confident so far! Created a branch with no issues.

Notes look like this:

cd ..

cd branch1 (or any directory)

ls (should show contents)

git commit -m “ comments go here “ 


Make sure to switch to the correct branch before the push:

git checkout (branch name)

git commit -m “ switched to (branch name) “


git push -u origin (main, branch1, etc)
